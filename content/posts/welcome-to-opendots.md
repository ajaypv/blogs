We're excited to introduce OpenDots, a platform designed to bring people together through shared interests and local connections.

## What is OpenDots?

OpenDots is more than just another social platform. It's a community-driven space where you can:

- **Find Roommates** - Connect with people looking for housing in your area
- **Join Spaces** - Discover and participate in community groups based on your interests
- **Plan Group Trips** - Organize adventures with like-minded travelers
- **Buy & Sell** - A trusted marketplace within your community
- **Attend Events** - Find sports events, meetups, and activities near you

## Why We Built This

We noticed a gap in how people connect locally. While social media connects us globally, finding a roommate, organizing a weekend trip, or joining a local sports event often requires jumping between multiple apps and platforms.

OpenDots brings all of this together in one place, powered by AI to help you find exactly what you're looking for.

## What's Next?

We're just getting started. In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

- Deep dives into our features
- Community stories and highlights
- Tips for getting the most out of OpenDots
- Behind-the-scenes looks at our development process

Stay tuned, and welcome to the community!
